## About The Project

Welcome to my portfolio homepage! ðŸŽ‰

I am a **Backend Engineer** with several years of experience, and I'm excited to showcase my journey and skills through this project. This homepage is not just a static page; it's a dynamic showcase of my professional life, featuring my experience timeline, technology stack, and contact details.

## Why This Project?

As part of my learning process in modern frontend development, I wanted to challenge myself by building this homepage using multiple JavaScript and CSS frameworks. This allows me to explore different technologies while providing a unique experience for visitors. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Framework Selection**: Users can choose which JavaScript and CSS frameworks they want to see in action. The default setup uses:
  - **JavaScript Framework**: Next.js (React)
  - **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5

- **Framework Options**:
  - **JavaScript Frameworks**:
    - React (default main application)
    - Vue 3 (soon)
    - Svelte (soon)
  - **CSS Frameworks**:
    - Bootstrap (default main application)
    - Tailwind
    - Bulma
    - Material (soon)
    - Chakra UI (soon)

## Architecture

- **Monorepo Structure**: This project uses **Npm Workspaces** to manage a monorepo, allowing for efficient dependency management and streamlined development.
- **Applications**: 
  - **React Application**: The frontend of the portfolio, built using React on Vite and various CSS frameworks.
  - **Express.js Application**: A backend service that fetches data from an API, providing the necessary information for the React application.

## How It Works

The homepage features a floating select option that allows viewers to switch between different frameworks seamlessly. This not only enhances the user experience but also demonstrates my ability to work with various technologies.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - JavaScript Frameworks: React, Vue 3, Svelte
  - CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma, Material, Chakra UI

- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js, Express (for any backend services if needed)
